## Written Report/ Analysis
As a new Chief Data Scientist for city's school district. In this capacity, I will be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, I have been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. I have access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. My task was  to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

## Conclusion:
-- I was able to conclude we had 9 charter schools and 6 District Schools in the dataset. 

-- District Schools budget was higher than the Charter Schools.

-- As far as school performances goes, Charter Schools performance was much better than District Schools.

-- I was able to conclude the ratio of the students was higher in district schools tthan charter schools which could have affected the  academic perfomance of the students .

-- Charter schools tend to have better performance than District schools .
